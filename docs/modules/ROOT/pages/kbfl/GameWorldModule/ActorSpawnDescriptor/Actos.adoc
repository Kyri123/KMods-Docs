= Actor Spawn Descriptor: Actors

== Basic

This System allow us to spawn easy new actors like buildings, spawner and more.

== Create a new actor spawn

First you need to create a new blueprint class from the parent `KBFLActorSpawnDescriptor` this class will use to set the options and information for the Actor.

after that we need to add this Description to our GameWorldModule. for that use the tab `Resource Nodes`
and ass this class to `M Actor Spawn Descriptors`

you can also mark classes to remove from the world with `M Actors to Remove`

And you can set in the GameWorldMode when the subsystem should start to spawn by change `m Call Nodes in Phase`. (I use `Initialization` as default)

[WARNING]
====
Please don't use `M Resource Nodes Information` and `M Options` this will not use by the Descriptor and based an old system that no longer supported and used (some mods still work with this system that's why I not remove that)

* `M Check Range` The range for the sphere for checking for other Actors (to prevent overlap and infinity spawn)
