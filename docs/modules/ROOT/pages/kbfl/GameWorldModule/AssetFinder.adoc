== What's the Asset Finder

The Asset finder helps you to easier register CDOHelper and Schematics, Research Trees and Recipes in the Mod Content registry.

It searches in the Folders that you set for these classes and register this then in the Mod Content registry.

== Using

After setup your xref:kbfl/GameWorldModule/howto.adoc[KBFL GameWorldModule] you have now a `KBFL GameWorldModule` section in the details. There are now 2 Inputs that can be toggled on and off. (if is off then will this code not executed and skipped by the system!)

- `M Asset Registry Options` This is the array for register Schematics, Research Trees and Recipes.

- `M Asset Cdo Finder` This is the array for register CDO helper classes in a given Phase.
