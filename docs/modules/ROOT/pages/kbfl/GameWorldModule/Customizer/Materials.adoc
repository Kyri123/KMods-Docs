= Customizer: Materials

== Basic

This system should it makes easier to add our new materials to existing other material desc.

That we can change from a new material back with the vanilla one.

== Using

* `M Material Information` Array of all Information for the CDO call
** `M Apply This Information To` Classes that we want to use as target for writing this information
** `M Valid Buildables` Buildables that we want to add for valid (is usefull if we make new buildabes with mor functionality like Solar Roof)
** `M Buildable Map` Buildable and target recipe (Buildable is normal the source what we target and the recipe is that what we want to replace)
