= Customizer: Swatches

== Basic

This system allow us to easily add new Swatches and default swatch groups to the game without do the many overwrite we need for that.

That allow us also to set the default colors for a swatch descriptor (Color Slot)


[WARNING]
====
This System check all swatches that we register here. +
If we use an already used slot the game will crash!
====

== Using

* `M Swatch Description` is the map for trigger the message form unlocked schematics.
** `M Swatch` is the swatch description where we set the ID for the color slot
** `M Primary Colour` is the first color for this swatch
** `M Secondary Colour` is the second color for this swatch
* `M Swatch Groups` This map bind new swatch groups to a swatch. This groups can use to set a default to custom buildable.
